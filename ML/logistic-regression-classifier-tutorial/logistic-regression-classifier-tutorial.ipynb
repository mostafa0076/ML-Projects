It is a supervised learning classification algorithm which is used to predict observations to a discrete set of classes. Practically, it is used to classify observations into different categories. Hence, its output is discrete in nature. **Logistic Regression** is also called **Logit Regression**. It is one of the most simple, straightforward and versatile classification algorithms which is used to solve classification problems."
